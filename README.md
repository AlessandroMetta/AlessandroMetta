# Hello World!
Hi, I'm 20, I'm form Alessandria, Piedmont, Italy and I love coding, I started coding from 15yo.

Now I live in Rome and I attend at [42RomaLuiss](https://42roma.it/), the BE(A)ST coding school, founded in Paris by Xavier Niel in Paris in 2013 and from 2021 also in Rome.

In my repos, you'll find my 42project. Feel free to download my code and try it. If you found errors or have suggestions for something I coded, create an issue inside the repo and report it. If you need help, email me. GLHFðŸ‘¾!

<!-- I'm also working on [my Italian 42Docs site](https://ametta42.github.io/42Docs_IT/) -->
